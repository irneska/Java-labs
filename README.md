# Java-labs
Second lab: 
Hierarchy of goods present in the clothing store

Third lab: 
Carry out the search for clothes necessary for the solemn reception. Sort search results by brand
Implement the ability to sort found goods by another type of parameter (optional, implemented as a separate method)
The implementation of sorting should provide the ability to sort both in descending and ascending order

In 4th lab I turned a project with code 2-3 work so that it could be built with Maven.

In the 5th lab I wrote unit tests for the code of my 4th lab.

In the 6th lab I implemented a list of objects present in the manager class in a CSV file. I also added checkstyle and spotbugs plugins to the pom.xml and checked the code with these parsers. Accordingly, it fixed all the errors that spotbugs were found and reduced the number of errors that checkstyle pointed out.
